# Compressor_Decompressor
Objective of the project is to reduce the number of bits needed to represent data through compression technique and also ensure that the compression is lossless so that when we decompress the data, it is restored in its original form without any loss of data. This will help in reducing the storage capacity of the file and quick transfer of file.
